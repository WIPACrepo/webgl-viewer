# webgl-viewer
webgl viewer for icecube events. used by masterclass

## Instructions

In the main directory, we have these files:

geo.py - Takes GCD files and makes geometry json.
i3.py - Takes i3 files and makes json frames.
main.py - Runs Tornado web server to serve up the static and dynamic content.
startup.sh - Sets the python environment and runs main.py.  This makes
    reference to an env directory, which lives in /home/dschultz/html_viewer

The templates directory contains the static templates for the site. You really
only need to look at base.html and main.html.  I should delete alt.html, since
that was for another 3d library.

The static directory contains all static files for the site.  Anything marked
with pre3d was for a different 3d engine that I'm not using anymore (was too
slow).  

Other contents:

textures directory - contains a few sprites for WebGL drawing of the DOMs.  I
    was experimenting a bit with different looks and settled on the sphere.png (I
    think).
custom.js - contains a launcher to start the ajax loading when the html has loaded
jquery.cookie.js - [not mine] a jquery cookie interaction plugin
jquery.mousewheel.js - [not mine] a jquery plugin to get mousewheel events
robots.txt - a standard robots file to prevent bots from looking here
Three.js - [not mine] the 3d library I currently use.  should be easy to google for it.
viewer.js - contains some helper functions and the actual viewer.
