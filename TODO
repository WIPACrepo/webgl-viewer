TODO:

more file/frame info (run, subrun, frame #, event id)

select multiple fits (present available options for each frame)

start with data warehouse browser, select file to open it in viewer

a way to mark interesting events, a way to easily share a link to it (update the url on each frame update)

(advanced) launch a limited python shell next to the viewer, or link to an ipython notebook with the file open and set to the same frame.
